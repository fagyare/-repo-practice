	<h2>More about Franklin</h2>
	<h3>Lifestyle - Welcome to my world</h3>

	<p>
		I have a few interesting hobbies I like to participate in. As mentioned before, I am into sports. My favorite sport and hobby is soccer. I play soccer 3 times a week with my team. We have an organized league that hosts an average of three tournaments a year.
	</p>

	<p>Most of my tv hours are for sports and the news. During the pandemic, I developed an interest in watching historical events and documentaries. I learned a lot about black history in this process.</p>

	<p>A fun fact about me is that I am African and do love to visit home as often as possible. I am from Ghana, West African. Ghana is one of the prominent countries on the African continent. It is known for its natural resources, rich culture and the people.</p>
